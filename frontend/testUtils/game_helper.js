Destroying everything in their path. But it's not all doom and gloom. In an abandoned missile silo, we've found one of our first weapons against the Storm you. We're looking for a few good commanders like you to help make a difference, push back the storm and protect those among us who are unable to protect themselves. Explore the world. Rescue survivors. Make hundreds of guns, swords, and things that go boom. Make impregnable forts. Tastefully decorate with sniper perches, poison gas traps, and jump pads. Take back the world. You know, the usual. And be sure to invite your friends. Welcome to Fortnite.",

You will enjoy every cutscene you encounter. The story is engaging, and it makes you feel that you are actually in the game. At this point, there is nothing to complain about with the game.

The steep learning curve turns off newbies to FPS games. \n\nThe environment in Overwatch is vibrant and sharp. The aesthetic is appropriate, but performance limitations hamper more impressive visuals. Overall, performance is just OK.\n\nThe story is linear and threadbare. A positive for players who want to jump into action. For the rest of us, it's unimaginative and boring. Playing with friends is a blast.\n\nThe learning curve is unnecessarily steep. New players will get lost because the opening tutorials suck and nothing is fully explained. Inventory management is a mess. However, players shouldn’t hesitate to experiment. \n\nGameplay is the weakest link. Moving is awkward. In all situations, character movement lacks fluidity. Camera angles are erratic and controlling it is a chore. The targeting feature is awful.\n\nOnce players grasp its nuances, they’ll that these flaws can be overlooked.",

My main gripe with the game is that their systems are severely underexplained by the game. There are several mechanics that are not addressed in the tutorial, and while the game rushes you to keep completing main quests, it never explains the better methods to grind and collect crafting materials.\n\nFor a new player unfamiliar with these features, like myself, it was frustrating and repetitive in the beginning. Other than that, this is a very polished game, and one that if you're a fan of FPS games you must buy.",
